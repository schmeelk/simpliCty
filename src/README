#test
The simpliCty compiler

Coded in OCaml, this takes a highly stripped-down subset of C (ints,
bools, and void types, arithmetic, if-else, for, and while statements,
and user-defined functions) and compiles it into LLVM IR.

It needs the OCaml llvm library, which is most easily installed through opam.

Install LLVM and its development libraries, the m4 macro preprocessor,
and opam, then use opam to install llvm.

The version of the OCaml llvm library should match the version of the LLVM
system installed on your system.
